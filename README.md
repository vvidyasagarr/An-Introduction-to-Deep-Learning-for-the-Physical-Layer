This Repository is the implementation of the research paper "An Introduction to Deep Learning for the Physical Layer" with the DOI "10.1109/TCCN.2017.2758370".  



The following repository presents an implementation of the research paper "An Introduction to Deep Learning for the Physical Layer" with the DOI "10.1109/TCCN.2017.2758370". In addition to replicating the original implementation, we have also made improvements to it. The paper originally showcased the performance of 2.2 BPSK and compared it to other modulation techniques. However, our implementation offers (8,8) BPSK and includes the implementation of Riecean Fading in the channel.
